       <h2>PONGAL</H2>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<h4>For Pongal:</h4>

<p>1.1 cup raw rice</p>
<p>2.1/4 cup split yellow moong dal (lentils)</p>
<p>3.2-3 cups water (adjust as needed)</p>
<p>4.1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns</p>
<p>5.1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</p>
<p>6.1/2 inch piece of ginger, finely chopped or grated</p>
<p>7.A pinch of asafoetida (hing)</p>
<p>8.2-3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</p>
<p>9.2-3 tablespoons cashew nuts</p>
<p>10.Salt to taste</p>

<h4>For Tempering:</h4>

<p>1-2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</p>
<p>A few curry leaves</p>
<p>2-3 dry red chilies (optional)</p>
<p>A pinch of asafoetida (hing)</p>

<h4>Method to cook:</h4>

<p>Wash the rice and lentils together and set them aside.</p>

<p>In a large, heavy-bottomed pan or pressure cooker, heat 2-3 tablespoons of ghee over medium heat.</p>

<p>Add black peppercorns, cumin seeds, grated ginger, and a pinch of asafoetida. Sauté for a minute or until they become fragrant.</p>

<p>Add the washed rice and lentils to the pan and sauté for another 2-3 minutes, ensuring they are well-coated with ghee and the spices.</p>

<p>Pour in 2-3 cups of water (adjust the quantity to your preferred consistency), add salt to taste, and mix well.</p>

<p>If using a pressure cooker, close the lid without the weight and cook for 2-3 whistles. If using a regular pan, cover and simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally, until the rice and lentils are soft and cooked. This might take around 20-25 minutes.</p>

<p>While the pongal is cooking, in a separate small pan, heat 2 tablespoons of ghee. Add cashew nuts and fry them until they turn golden brown. Remove and set aside.</p>

<p>In the same pan, add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves, dry red chilies (if using), and a pinch of asafoetida for tempering. Allow them to splutter and become aromatic.</p>

<p>Once the pongal is cooked, add the tempered spices to the pongal and mix well.</p>

<p>Finally, add the fried cashew nuts, and your Pongal is ready to serve.</p>





<h2>PASTA</H2>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<h4>For the Pasta:</h4>

<p>1.8 ounces (about 2 cups) of pasta (e.g., spaghetti, fettuccine, penne)</p>
<p>2.Water for boiling</p>
<p>3.Salt (for boiling water)</p>
<p>4.Tomato sauce</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<h4>Boil the Pasta:</h4>

<p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous pinch of salt to the boiling water.</p>
<p>Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package instructions or until it reaches your desired level of doneness (usually about 8-12 minutes).</p>
<p>Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. When the pasta is done, it should be al dente, meaning it's cooked but still slightly firm to the bite.</p>
<p>Drain the cooked pasta in a colander and set it aside.</p>
<p>Transfer the pasta to serving plates.</p>
<p>Garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves if desired.</p>
<p>Serve hot and enjoy your homemade pasta!</p>
